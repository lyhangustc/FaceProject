\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

We propose a novel sketch-to-face translation model which is robust to hand-drawn sketches. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in generating high quality realistic face image from sketches. 


\subsection{Comparison with Image Translation networks}

Existing DNNs for image translation can be trained for sketch-photo translation using the paired dataset.
