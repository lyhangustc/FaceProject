\td{All existing methods for local face editing require the user to provide masks and strokes manually}. In comparison, strokes are only the input to indicate the desired shape. Our system automatically interprets the intended edit and produces the local change accurately. This greatly reduces users' burden and preserves the fluency of user interaction. 

\td{Only local edit in a relatively small area is supported.} As reported in SC-FEGAN~\cite{}, artifacts appear when complete a large region in FaceShop~\cite{}.
