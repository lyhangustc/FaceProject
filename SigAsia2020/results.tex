\subsection{Sketch Interface}
We develop a sketch-based interface which allows common users to describe their desired face and part shapes by a few strokes. Once the user finishes his drawing, the generated face image is shown on the right \td{bottom of the sketch? This will be helpful for local editing.}, as Fig.~\ref{fig:interface} shows.
The user is allowed to edit the sketch by erasing strokes or adding new stroke to change eye shapes, noses shapes, eyebrows, and so on.
%
Each round of face image generation after users' modification takes about \td{... seconds on a XXX GPU with xxGB memory.}

\subsection{Comparison with Image Translation networks}

Existing DNNs for image translation can be trained for sketch-photo translation using the paired dataset.
