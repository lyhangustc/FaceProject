# 3-29
## homework and half a day off.


# 3-28
## Group meeting(to do list)
* Complete the motivation of experiments, the reason to do this exp. More details about the exp.
* Use hand-drawn contour to run global version0 and global version2, see the performance.
* Read paper UNSUPERVISED GENERATIVE ATTENTIONAL NETWORKS WITH ADAPTIVE LAYERINSTANCE NORMALIZATION FOR IMAGE-TO-IMAGE
TRANSLATION
* Try to design a local spatial norm
* Read paper Unsupervised Discovery of Object Landmarks as Structural Representations
## Interactive System 
* Fix some bugs
* Write guidelines.



# 3-26
## Courses
* full class during afternoon and evening
## t-sne
* Double check the details of the data, make sure everything is right.
* Print out the coordinates and shape of each feature map.
<div align="center">
  <img src = '/t-sne/Figure/fig1.png' width = '230px' height = '220px'>
</div>

* Run experiments to test the effects of perplexity.
* Analyse the results, observation and conclusion are in t-sne folder.
## Documents
* Continue to complete documents in Github. (Quite slow, first time use github to write documents.)
## experiment results
* Try to upload the results of global_verison0(refer to version log in pix2pixHD/results)
* Can't upload results to github due to bad network.
# 3-25
## Github preparation
* Learn the basic operation of github
## Experiments
### Pix2pixHD
* Global model version_1: remove the first two instance norm and train the model on SCC cluster
## Documents
* Complete part of t-sne report
* Write Pix2pixHD and contour related documents.
