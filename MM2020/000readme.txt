These LaTeX source files, when compiled, will produce a fully-anonymized sample article
suitable for submission to the SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia conferences. 

It is your responsibility to ensure that you are using v1.55 or higher of the "acmart"
class. 

The ACM article class files are available to download from: 
https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.

The User Guide, which goes into great detail on how to use the "acmart" class, including
a list of the LaTeX packages which need to be installed in order for you to be successful
in using it, is available to download from:
https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart.pdf

Your formatted article must display the submission ID on the first page, and on each
of the even-numbered pages in the page header, as shown in the sample PDF.
