	\caption{The architecture of our dual-generator model. In order to train a face image generator $G_m$ for hand-drawn sketches, we synthesize deformed sketches $\dfmS$ from an edge-aligned sketch $\synS$ and design a spatially attention pooling module to extract shape and structure features from distorted sketches. The dual generators $G_m$ and $G_a$ are trained simultaneously in an adversarial manner. }
