## Meeting Note 2019-9-24
### Discussion
##### Image generation from attribute values
* Image generation from attribute values (instead of attribute labels)
##### Image generation by mixing two images
* Weights of two input images
* Two potential methods based on two architectures: conditional and unconditional
* Artbreeder.com
##### Image generation from sketches progressively
* Image generation progressively from sketches (stroke by stroke, instead of entire well-drawn sketches)
### Future work
* Mask-face dataset survey
* Face2mask, face parsing survey
* Mask2Face generation by pix2pixHD
* Mask editing interface
* Image generation by mixing images survey
